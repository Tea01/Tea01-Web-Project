                        <p>School in Albania starts at the first or second week of September and for 9 month in a row continues, until June. There are some holidays too that we celebrate. For example for New Year we are given 2 weeks holidays. There are also some National Holidaystoo.</p>
                        <h2>Elementary School</h2>
                        <p>
                           Elementary School in Albania starts from the 1st grade until the 5th grade. Children can enter the school when they are 5-6-7 years old. Most children enter the school at the age of 6.
                           In elementary school the highest grade is 5 and the lowest one is 1. In some schools the number of students is high so there are classes in the morning and in the afternoon too.
                           There are public and private schools. Both of them give good education.
                           At the 3rd grade in every school students get a foreign language class. It depends from the school which language you get to learn: English, French, Italian, German.
                           <br><br>
                           I entered elementary school when I was 6 years old and I was send to a public school. My school building was quite old but the teachers and the education was really good. And sometimes I go and visit them.

                        <h2>Middle School</h2>
                        <p>
                          Middle School starts from 6th to 9th grade. The highest grade is 10 and the lowest one is 4. In middle-school one school year has 3 semesters. For each semester children have to create a folder for each subject and put there all the works that they do and projects too. Each semester they enter one big exam for every subcjet. The grade is valueded by the Folder Performance, the Speaking Performance(during the lesson how the child responds to the teacher's questions) and by the Exam Performance. Each of them are really important. At the end of the 9th grade every student enters 3 exams prepared by the Ministry of Education. These exams are important, in order to continue your studies to a good high school you must do well in these exams too. The exams that students enter are: Math, Literature and Second Language(English/French/German/Italian). Every school teaches different foreign languages.
                          <br><br>
                          In the school where I studied I learned English as my second language. During the Middle school I took place in different activities. I played in volleyball matches between schools. And for two years my school took the second place. <br> I also took place in different Sprit activities where once I took the second place. Also in a 1000m run I took the fist place in my city.
                          After the 8th grade I changed city therefor I entered a new school too.

                        <h2>High School</h2>
                        <p>
                            High school starts from the 10th until the 12th grade. This are the most important years for students because they get to learn a lot of new things and the studies that they take in high school are really hard. Just like in the middle school the education system is the same, with three semesters. At the last year of high school students get to choose what they want to study: Social or Science classes. Here everyone chooses the classes they want and like this they start to prepare for th exams that will be hold at the end of the year by the Ministry of Education. Students enter in 4 exams: Literature, Math, Second Language(B2+ level) and one exam that they choos to have, for example: Physics or Philosophy or Ecomonics etc.
                            At the end of the last year and the exams all the students gather together one night with their teachers too to celebrate the end of one part of their life.
                            <br><br>
                            During the High School I entered a Chemistry Olympiad and I was able to pass the first phase in my school and later on the second one between the city students.
                            For three years in high school I finished successfully a lot of projects in different subjects too.

                           The grade that students have got during the three years of High School and the grades that are taken in the exams made by the Ministry of Education are important for them in order to be able to enter in the public universities. It is really hard to win a place in a public university because you need to have really high grades. 
                           There are also private universities in which you do not need to have good grades in order to continue your studies there.
                           University in Albania continues for 3 years and after that if you want you can continue with Master Degree.
